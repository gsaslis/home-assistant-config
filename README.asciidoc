= Home Assistant Config by Yorgos

:toc: auto

This repo exposes the Home Assistant functionality I've built up over the years
that I think is worth sharing with the world. (i.e. this isn't "everything", 
nor is this repo somehow linked (today) to my actual running home assistant 
instance). Docs are currently work-in-progress, but the configuration is 100% 
functional.
